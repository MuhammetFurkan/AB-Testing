### AB-Testing

# **Business Problem**
Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding".
Our customers decided to test this new feature and want to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding.
A/B testing has been going on for 1 month and customers now ask you to analyze the results of this A/B test. waiting. The ultimate success criterion is Purchase.
Therefore, the focus should be on the Purchase metric for statistical testing.

# **Features:**
* **impression:** Ad views count
* **Click:** Number of clicks on the displayed ad
* **Purchase:** The number of products purchased after the ads clicked
* **Earning:** Earnings after purchased products
